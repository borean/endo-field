explainer: >
  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders 
  affecting adrenal steroidogenesis, with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) accounting 
  for 90-95% of cases. Classic CAH presents in infancy with salt-wasting crisis or 
  virilization, while non-classic forms may present later with hirsutism and menstrual 
  irregularities. Newborn screening has dramatically improved early detection and outcomes.

## Key Points

- Most common cause of adrenal insufficiency in children
- 21-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 90-95% of CAH cases
- Autosomal recessive inheritance (CYP21A2 gene)
- Newborn screening detects classic forms early
- Three phenotypes: salt-wasting, simple virilizing, non-classic

## Genetics

### CYP21A2 Gene

- Location: Chromosome 6p21.3 (within HLA complex)
- Encodes: 21-hydroxylase enzyme (P450c21)
- Function: Converts 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) → 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone → 11-deoxycorticosterone
- Mutations cause impaired cortisol and aldosterone synthesis

### Common Mutations

1. **Large gene deletions/conversions** (~20% of alleles)
   - Complete loss of function → salt-wasting phenotype

2. **I172N (p.Ile172Asn)** (~15% of alleles)
   - Partial function retained → simple virilizing phenotype

3. **V281L (p.Val281Leu)** (~10% of alleles)
   - Mild deficiency → non-classic phenotype

4. **P30L (p.Pro30Leu)** (~5% of alleles)
   - Variable phenotype

## Clinical Presentation

### Classic CAH - Salt-Wasting Form (75% of classic cases)

**Infancy:**
- Adrenal crisis: vomiting, dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, shock
- Usually presents at 1-4 weeks of life
- Can be fatal if untreated
- Females: ambiguous genitalia at birth (clitoromegaly, labial fusion)
- Males: normal external genitalia (may delay diagnosis)

**Childhood/Adulthood:**
- Precocious puberty (due to excess androgens)
- Rapid growth with early epiphyseal fusion → short adult height
- Hirsutism, acne, virilization in females
- Testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs) in males

### Classic CAH - Simple Virilizing Form (25% of classic cases)

- No salt-wasting (some aldosterone production preserved)
- Females: ambiguous genitalia at birth
- Males: normal at birth, precocious puberty later
- Normal electrolytes

### Non-Classic CAH (Late-Onset)

- Presents in adolescence/adulthood
- Females: hirsutism, acne, irregular menses, infertility
- Males: often asymptomatic or mild precocious puberty
- Normal electrolytes, no adrenal crisis

## Diagnosis

### Newborn Screening

- Measures 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in dried blood spot
- Detects classic CAH before symptoms develop
- False positives: prematurity, stress, other conditions
- Confirmatory testing required for positive screens

### Laboratory Testing

**Baseline:**
- Elevated 17-OHP (markedly elevated in classic, mildly in non-classic)
- Elevated androstenedione
- Elevated testosterone (in females)
- Low or normal cortisol
- Low aldosterone (salt-wasting form)
- Elevated renin (compensatory)

**ACTH Stimulation Test:**
- 17-OHP > 1000 ng/dL (classic)
- 17-OHP 200-1000 ng/dL (non-classic)
- Cortisol response may be blunted

### Genetic Testing

- CYP21A2 gene sequencing
- Useful for:
  - Confirming diagnosis
  - Genetic counseling
  - Prenatal diagnosis
  - Predicting phenotype severity

## Management

### Acute Management (Salt-Wasting Crisis)

1. **Fluid resuscitation**
   - Normal saline bolus: 20 mL/kg
   - Correct hyponatremia gradually

2. **Glucocorticoid replacement**
   - Hydrocortisone: 25-50 mg/m²/day IV (stress dosing)
   - Or dexamethasone: 1-2 mg IV if available

3. **Mineralocorticoid replacement**
   - Fludrocortisone: 0.1-0.2 mg/day (once stable)

4. **Monitor**
   - Electrolytes, glucose, vital signs
   - Watch for hypoglycemia

### Chronic Management

**Glucocorticoid Replacement:**
- Hydrocortisone: 10-15 mg/m²/day (divided 2-3 times daily)
- Prednisone/prednisolone: alternative for older children/adults
- Dexamethasone: once daily, but higher risk of growth suppression
- **Goal:** Suppress ACTH and androgens while minimizing growth suppression

**Mineralocorticoid Replacement (salt-wasting only):**
- Fludrocortisone: 0.1-0.2 mg/day
- Monitor: renin, electrolytes, blood pressure
- May need salt supplementation in infancy

**Stress Dosing:**
- Minor illness/fever: 2-3x maintenance
- Surgery/major stress: 10x maintenance (IV if needed)
- Important: patients and families must understand emergency protocols

### Monitoring

**Clinical:**
- Growth velocity (watch for over-suppression)
- Pubertal development
- Blood pressure
- Signs of virilization (hirsutism, acne)

**Laboratory:**
- 17-OHP, androstenedione (target: upper normal range)
- Testosterone (in females)
- Renin (salt-wasting form)
- Cortisol (morning level, but less reliable)
- Bone age (annually in children)

## Surgical Considerations

### Females with Ambiguous Genitalia

- Genitoplasty: timing controversial
- Early vs. delayed surgery
- Requires multidisciplinary team (endocrinology, urology, psychology)
- Shared decision-making with family

## Complications

### Short-Term

- Adrenal crisis (life-threatening)
- Hypoglycemia
- Electrolyte imbalances

### Long-Term

- Short stature (from overtreatment or undertreatment)
- Obesity, metabolic syndrome
- Osteoporosis (from chronic glucocorticoid use)
- Infertility (especially in males with TARTs)
- Psychological impact (body image, gender identity)

## Interpretation / Caveats

- Newborn screening has dramatically improved outcomes
- Balancing androgen suppression with growth is challenging
- Over-treatment → growth suppression, Cushingoid features
- Under-treatment → virilization, short stature, adrenal crisis risk
- Non-classic CAH may not require treatment unless symptomatic
- Genetic counseling important for family planning
- Prenatal treatment (dexamethasone) controversial and experimental
- Transition to adult care requires careful planning
