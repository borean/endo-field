explainer: >
  Cushing syndrome is caused by prolonged exposure to excess cortisol, either from 
  exogenous sources (iatrogenic) or endogenous overproduction. In children, it most 
  commonly results from exogenous glucocorticoid therapy, but endogenous causes include 
  ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas (Cushing disease), adrenal tumors, and ectopic ACTH 
  secretion. Early diagnosis is crucial as prolonged hypercortisolism leads to growth 
  failure, obesity, and significant metabolic complications.

## Key Points

- Excess cortisol from exogenous or endogenous sources
- Most common in children: iatrogenic (glucocorticoid therapy)
- Endogenous: Cushing disease (60%), adrenal tumors (30%), ectopic ACTH (rare)
- Classic features: growth failure, weight gain, facial plethora, striae
- Diagnosis: confirm hypercortisolism → determine ACTH-dependent vs independent

## Etiology

### Exogenous (Most Common in Children)

- Chronic glucocorticoid therapy
- Any route: oral, inhaled, topical, intranasal, intra-articular
- Dose and duration dependent

### Endogenous

**ACTH-Dependent (60-70%)**
1. **Cushing Disease** - Pituitary adenoma secreting ACTH
   - Most common endogenous cause in children
   - Female predominance (except in young children)
   - Often microadenomas (<10 mm)

2. **Ectopic ACTH Secretion** - Rare in children
   - Bronchial carcinoid tumors
   - Pheochromocytoma
   - Medullary thyroid carcinoma

**ACTH-Independent (30-40%)**
1. **Adrenal Adenoma** 
   - Usually unilateral
   - Variable cortisol production

2. **Adrenal Carcinoma**
   - More common in children than adults
   - Often large tumors (>6 cm)
   - May produce multiple steroids

3. **Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease (PPNAD)**
   - Part of Carney complex
   - Bilateral micronodular adrenal hyperplasia

4. **Bilateral Macronodular Hyperplasia** - Rare in children

## Clinical Presentation

### Growth and Development

- **Growth failure** - most specific finding in children
- Deceleration of linear growth with weight gain
- Delayed puberty or arrested puberty
- Advanced bone age initially, then delayed

### Physical Appearance

- **Central obesity** with relative limb sparing
- **Moon facies** (rounded face)
- **Facial plethora** (facial flushing)
- **Buffalo hump** (dorsal fat pad)
- **Supraclavicular fat pads**

### Skin Changes

- **Purple striae** (>1 cm wide)
- Thin, fragile skin
- Easy bruising
- Acne
- Hirsutism
- Poor wound healing

### Metabolic

- Glucose intolerance / diabetes mellitus
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- Osteoporosis / fractures

### Psychological

- Mood changes (depression, irritability)
- Cognitive impairment
- Sleep disturbances

## Diagnosis

### Step 1: Confirm Hypercortisolism

Choose 2 of 3 tests:

**1. 24-Hour Urine Free Cortisol (UFC)**
- Collect 2-3 samples
- Elevated: >3x upper limit of normal
- Less reliable in children due to collection issues

**2. Late-Night Salivary Cortisol**
- Collect at 11 PM-midnight
- Preserves circadian rhythm testing
- Elevated: >2x upper limit of normal
- Best screening test in children

**3. Low-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test (LDDST)**
- Give 1 mg dexamethasone at 11 PM (or 15 μg/kg in children)
- Measure cortisol at 8 AM next morning
- Normal: cortisol <1.8 μg/dL
- Cushing: cortisol remains elevated

### Step 2: Determine ACTH-Dependent vs Independent

**Measure Plasma ACTH** (morning, 8 AM)
- ACTH <5 pg/mL → ACTH-independent (adrenal cause)
- ACTH 5-20 pg/mL → Equivocal
- ACTH >20 pg/mL → ACTH-dependent (pituitary or ectopic)

### Step 3: Localize the Source

**If ACTH-Dependent:**

1. **High-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test (HDDST)**
   - 8 mg dexamethasone at 11 PM (or 120 μg/kg)
   - Cortisol measured at 8 AM
   - Suppression >50% → Cushing disease (pituitary)
   - No suppression → Ectopic ACTH

2. **CRH Stimulation Test**
   - Give CRH IV
   - Measure ACTH and cortisol response
   - Increase >20% → Pituitary source
   - No response → Ectopic

3. **Pituitary MRI**
   - Identify adenoma (may be very small)
   - Negative MRI doesn't rule out Cushing disease

4. **Inferior Petrosal Sinus Sampling (IPSS)**
   - Gold standard if imaging inconclusive
   - Catheterize petrosal sinuses, measure ACTH
   - Central:peripheral ACTH >2:1 (basal) or >3:1 (CRH-stimulated) → Pituitary

**If ACTH-Independent:**

1. **Adrenal CT or MRI**
   - Identify adenoma vs carcinoma
   - Assess size, characteristics
   - Large (>6 cm), irregular → suspect carcinoma

2. **Adrenal vein sampling** - rarely needed in children

## Management

### Iatrogenic Cushing Syndrome

- Gradual taper of exogenous glucocorticoids
- Assess HPA axis recovery
- May require physiologic replacement during taper
- Consider alternate-day dosing or local therapy

### Cushing Disease (Pituitary)

**First-line: Transsphenoidal Surgery**
- Selective adenomectomy
- Cure rate: 70-90% for microadenomas
- Lower for macroadenomas
- Complications: diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism

**Medical Therapy** (bridge to surgery or if surgery fails)
- Ketoconazole: inhibits steroidogenesis
- Metyrapone: blocks 11β-hydroxylase
- Cabergoline: dopamine agonist
- Pasireotide: somatostatin analog

**Radiation Therapy**
- If surgery fails or not feasible
- Stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife)
- High cure rate but delayed (months-years)

**Bilateral Adrenalectomy**
- Last resort if other treatments fail
- Requires lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement
- Risk of Nelson syndrome (pituitary tumor progression)

### Adrenal Tumors

**Adenoma:**
- Unilateral adrenalectomy
- Laparoscopic approach preferred
- Usually curative

**Carcinoma:**
- Surgical resection (open approach)
- Wide margins, lymph node dissection
- Adjuvant mitotane therapy
- Poor prognosis if metastatic

### Post-Treatment

- HPA axis suppression expected after cure
- Glucocorticoid replacement needed (typically 12-18 months)
- Monitor for recurrence
- Address complications: osteoporosis, growth, psychological

## Complications

### Acute

- Adrenal crisis after surgery (HPA suppression)
- Surgical complications
- Infection risk

### Long-Term

- **Growth failure** - may not fully recover
- Osteoporosis and fractures
- Cardiovascular disease
- Metabolic syndrome
- Psychological sequelae
- Nelson syndrome (after bilateral adrenalectomy)

## Interpretation / Caveats

- Diagnosis challenging in children due to non-specific symptoms
- Growth failure + weight gain should raise suspicion
- Midnight salivary cortisol most practical screening in children
- Cushing disease harder to diagnose than in adults (smaller adenomas)
- IPSS gold standard but invasive, requires experienced center
- Post-cure: HPA axis recovery takes months; requires glucocorticoid replacement
- Long-term follow-up essential: growth, bone health, psychological support
- Adrenal carcinoma has poor prognosis despite aggressive treatment
