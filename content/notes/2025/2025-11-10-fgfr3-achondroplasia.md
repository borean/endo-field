explainer: >
  Achondroplasia is the most common form of disproportionate short stature (dwarfism), 
  caused by gain-of-function mutations in the FGFR3 gene. The condition is characterized 
  by rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features. 
  Most cases result from a specific G380R mutation in FGFR3, leading to constitutive 
  activation of the receptor and impaired endochondral bone growth.

## Key Points

- Most common form of disproportionate short stature (1 in 15,000-40,000 live births)
- Autosomal dominant inheritance (80% de novo mutations)
- Caused by gain-of-function mutations in FGFR3 gene
- Classic mutation: G380R (c.1138G>A) in >95% of cases
- Rhizomelic (proximal) limb shortening is characteristic

## Genetics

### FGFR3 Gene

- Location: Chromosome 4p16.3
- Encodes: Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3
- Function: Negative regulator of endochondral bone growth
- Mutations cause constitutive activation → excessive inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation

### Common Mutations

1. **G380R (c.1138G>A)** - Most common (>95% of cases)
   - Substitution at position 380: glycine → arginine
   - Located in transmembrane domain
   - Results in ligand-independent receptor activation

2. **G375C (c.1123G>T)** - Rare variant
   - Similar phenotype to G380R

## Clinical Features

### Growth

- Average adult height: ~130 cm (4'3") in males, ~125 cm (4'1") in females
- Rhizomelic shortening (proximal > distal)
- Normal trunk length
- Disproportionate short stature evident at birth

### Craniofacial

- Macrocephaly with frontal bossing
- Midface hypoplasia
- Depressed nasal bridge
- Prognathism

### Skeletal

- Short, broad hands ("trident hand" - separation between 3rd and 4th fingers)
- Genu varum (bow legs)
- Lumbar lordosis
- Narrow foramen magnum (risk of cervicomedullary compression)

### Neurologic

- Risk of hydrocephalus (due to narrow foramen magnum)
- Cervicomedullary compression (can be life-threatening in infancy)
- Spinal stenosis (common in adults)

## Diagnosis

### Clinical

- Characteristic physical features
- Radiographic findings:
  - Short, broad long bones
  - "Champagne glass" pelvis
  - Narrow interpediculate distances in lumbar spine
  - Rhomboid-shaped foramen magnum

### Genetic Testing

- Targeted mutation analysis for G380R (c.1138G>A)
- FGFR3 gene sequencing if negative
- Prenatal diagnosis available via CVS or amniocentesis

## Management

### Growth

- Growth hormone therapy: Limited efficacy (may improve height by 5-10 cm)
- Limb lengthening: Surgical option, controversial
- Vosoritide (C-type natriuretic peptide analog): FDA-approved for children ≥5 years
  - Increases growth velocity
  - Requires daily subcutaneous injections

### Monitoring

- Regular head circumference measurements (infancy/early childhood)
- Neurologic assessment for signs of compression
- Sleep studies (obstructive sleep apnea common)
- Spinal imaging if symptoms of stenosis

### Complications

- **Infancy**: Foramen magnum stenosis → cervicomedullary compression
- **Childhood**: Obstructive sleep apnea, recurrent otitis media
- **Adulthood**: Spinal stenosis, obesity, joint problems

## Interpretation / Caveats

- Most cases are de novo (advanced paternal age is a risk factor)
- Homozygous mutations (both parents affected) → lethal in neonatal period
- Growth hormone has limited benefit due to receptor-level defect
- Newer targeted therapies (vosoritide, FGFR3 inhibitors) show promise
- Life expectancy is normal with appropriate management
- Quality of life considerations: social stigma, accessibility, medical complications
