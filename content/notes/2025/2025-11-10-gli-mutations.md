  GLI transcription factors (GLI1, GLI2, GLI3) are key mediators of the Hedgehog signaling 
  pathway, which is critical for pituitary development. Mutations in GLI2 and GLI3 are 
  associated with congenital hypopituitarism, often in combination with holoprosencephaly 
  spectrum disorders. GLI2 mutations are the most common genetic cause of isolated growth 
  hormone deficiency with or without additional pituitary hormone deficiencies.

## Key Points

- GLI transcription factors (GLI1, GLI2, GLI3) mediate Hedgehog signaling in pituitary development
- GLI2 mutations: most common genetic cause of isolated GHD
- GLI3 mutations: associated with holoprosencephaly and pituitary defects
- Variable phenotype: isolated GHD to panhypopituitarism
- May present with midline defects (cleft lip/palate, holoprosencephaly)
- Autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expressivity

## Clinical Features

### GLI2 Mutations
- Isolated growth hormone deficiency (most common)
- Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (GH, TSH, ACTH, gonadotropins)
- Midline defects: cleft lip/palate, single central incisor
- Holoprosencephaly (rare, severe cases)
- Normal intelligence in most cases

### GLI3 Mutations
- Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome
- Pallister-Hall syndrome (hypothalamic hamartoma, polydactyly)
- Pituitary hormone deficiencies (variable)
- Holoprosencephaly spectrum
- Polydactyly, syndactyly

## Genetics

- GLI2: chromosome 2q14.2, autosomal dominant
- GLI3: chromosome 7p14.1, autosomal dominant
- Variable penetrance and expressivity
- De novo mutations common
- Family history may be absent

## Diagnosis

- Clinical features: short stature, pituitary hormone deficiencies, midline defects
- Genetic testing: GLI2, GLI3 sequencing
- Brain MRI: pituitary hypoplasia, midline defects, holoprosencephaly
- Pituitary function testing: comprehensive hormone panel

## Management

- Hormone replacement as needed
- Growth hormone therapy for GHD
- Monitor for additional hormone deficiencies
- Multidisciplinary care: endocrinology, genetics, neurosurgery (if holoprosencephaly)
- Genetic counseling

## Interpretation / Caveats

- GLI2 mutations have highly variable expressivity - family members may be unaffected
- Pituitary deficiencies may develop over time - requires ongoing monitoring
- Midline defects may be subtle (single central incisor)
- Not all GLI2 mutation carriers develop hypopituitarism
- Consider GLI mutations in familial or syndromic hypopituitarism
