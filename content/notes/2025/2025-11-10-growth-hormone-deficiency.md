explainer: >
  Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is characterized by inadequate secretion of growth 
  hormone from the anterior pituitary, leading to short stature and other metabolic 
  abnormalities. It can be congenital or acquired, isolated or part of multiple pituitary 
  hormone deficiencies. Early diagnosis and treatment with recombinant human growth hormone 
  can significantly improve final adult height.

## Key Points

- Inadequate GH secretion from anterior pituitary
- Presents with short stature, delayed bone age, hypoglycemia
- Can be congenital or acquired, isolated or multiple pituitary hormone deficiency
- Diagnosis: GH stimulation testing, IGF-1, bone age
- Treatment: recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH)
- Early treatment improves final adult height

## Clinical Features

- Progressive growth failure
- Short stature (height <-2 SD)
- Delayed bone age
- Increased adiposity
- Hypoglycemia (especially in infants)
- Micropenis in males
