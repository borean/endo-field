explainer: >
  Congenital hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth, most commonly 
  due to thyroid dysgenesis. It is one of the most common preventable causes of intellectual 
  disability. Newborn screening and early treatment with levothyroxine can prevent 
  neurodevelopmental impairment.
