explainer: >
  Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) is the most common sex chromosome aneuploidy in males, 
  with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 500-1000 live male births. However, many cases 
  remain undiagnosed until adulthood, particularly mosaic variants which may present 
  with milder phenotypes.

  - "Is neonatal detection improving prevalence estimates?"
  - "Impact of ascertainment bias in mosaic cases?"

## Key Points

- Most common sex chromosome aneuploidy in males (47,XXY)
- Estimated prevalence: 1 in 500-1000 live male births
- Many cases undiagnosed until adulthood
- Mosaic variants (46,XY/47,XXY) may have milder phenotypes

## Clinical Presentation

### Classic Features

- Tall stature with eunuchoid proportions
- Small, firm testes
- Gynecomastia (in ~50% of cases)
- Infertility (azoospermia)
- Learning disabilities and behavioral issues

### Mosaic Variants

Mosaic Klinefelter syndrome (46,XY/47,XXY) may present with:

- Less severe hypogonadism
- Some preserved testicular function
- Variable fertility potential
- Milder cognitive/behavioral features

## Diagnosis

- Karyotype analysis (gold standard)
- FISH for rapid screening
- Consider in males with:
  - Unexplained hypogonadism
  - Infertility
  - Learning/behavioral issues
  - Tall stature with small testes

## Management

- Testosterone replacement therapy (if hypogonadal)
- Fertility counseling (consider TESE/IVF)
- Educational support
- Regular monitoring for:
  - Metabolic syndrome
  - Osteoporosis
  - Autoimmune conditions

## Interpretation / Caveats

- Prevalence estimates may be low due to underdiagnosis
- Mosaic cases may be underrepresented in studies
- Ascertainment bias: more severe cases diagnosed earlier
- Neonatal screening programs may reveal higher true prevalence
