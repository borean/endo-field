explainer: >
  Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) is a rare congenital condition characterized by the classic 
  triad of optic nerve hypoplasia, pituitary hormone deficiencies, and midline brain defects 
  (septum pellucidum and/or corpus callosum abnormalities). It presents with visual 
  impairment, growth failure, and other endocrine deficiencies. Early recognition and 
  multidisciplinary management are essential for optimal outcomes.

  - "Optimal screening protocol for pituitary function in SOD?"
  - "Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes?"
  - "Genetic variants beyond HESX1, SOX2, OTX2?"

## Key Points

- Classic triad: optic nerve hypoplasia, pituitary hormone deficiencies, midline brain defects
- Most common cause of congenital hypopituitarism
- Variable presentation: complete triad in ~30% of cases
- Growth hormone deficiency most common (60-70%)
- ACTH deficiency can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia
- Genetic causes: HESX1, SOX2, OTX2 mutations

## Clinical Features

### Visual
- Optic nerve hypoplasia (unilateral or bilateral)
- Nystagmus
- Strabismus
- Visual field defects
- Variable visual acuity (normal to blindness)

### Endocrine
- Growth hormone deficiency (60-70%)
- ACTH deficiency (40-60%) - can cause hypoglycemia
- TSH deficiency (20-30%)
- Gonadotropin deficiency (15-20%)
- ADH deficiency (diabetes insipidus) - rare

### Neurological
- Midline brain defects (septum pellucidum absent in 50-80%)
- Corpus callosum abnormalities
- Schizencephaly
- Intellectual disability (variable)
- Seizures

## Diagnosis

- Clinical triad (not all features required)
- Brain MRI: optic nerve hypoplasia, midline defects
- Pituitary function testing: GH, ACTH, TSH, gonadotropins
- Genetic testing: HESX1, SOX2, OTX2
- Ophthalmologic evaluation

## Management

- Multidisciplinary team: endocrinology, ophthalmology, neurology
- Hormone replacement as needed
- Monitor for ACTH deficiency (hypoglycemia risk)
- Visual support and rehabilitation
- Neurodevelopmental follow-up

## Interpretation / Caveats

- Incomplete triad is common - diagnosis can be made with 2/3 features
- Pituitary deficiencies may develop over time - requires ongoing monitoring
- ACTH deficiency can present with hypoglycemia in infancy
- Visual prognosis depends on severity of optic nerve hypoplasia
- Genetic testing identifies cause in ~1% of cases
